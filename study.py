Last night, during the HS fair, a unique idea suddenly came to me that I believe can revolutionize our recruitment efforts.\n\nIdea #1: Virtual Turbo Presentations during Middle School Advisory/Homeroom via Zoom\n\nQuick and Impactful: Designed for an advisory/homeroom period.\n\nSlide Deck Content: Highlighting achievements, student success stories, culture, clubs, and teams.\n\nFlexibility: Options for a live session or a pre-recorded 7-minute video, including a Q&A segment. The pre-recorded Q&A can have 9th graders asking the questions and Staff and Upper Classman answering them. You should also have a facilitator guide with the Q&A portion transcribed with a one pager with the facts and features.\n\n\n\nIdea #2: Virtual Turbo Presentations during PTA Meetings\n\nTailored for Parents: Addressing unique parent concerns.\n\nSlide Deck Content for PTAs:\n\nSafety: Assurance of student safety.\n\nSupport: Overviews of SEL, mentorship, and more.\n\nSuccess: Alumni success stories and our college admissions track record.\n\nHere are some email templates you can refine and expand on:\n\n\nEmail Template for PTA Outreach\n\nSubject: Collaboration Opportunity: Discover [Your High School Name]\n\nDear [PTA Leader's Name/PTA Committee],\n\nGreetings from [Your High School Name]!

Consider our roles less as fixers and more akin to triage ( quickly prioritizing and directing families to the right resources or support teams).\n\nPart of that involves connecting families to our Student Support Teams, Academic Leadership Teams, and even community-based organizations. This is why understanding the roles of all players on our team and networking effectively is so vital.\n\n\n\nLet's focus on building robust relationships, open communication, and fostering joy in our interactions. It's not about busyness, but about impact. Working smarter ensures we go home with 'gas in the tank'‚Äîfor our families, friends, and future dreams.\n\n\n\nBy remembering lessons from the past, being mindful in the present, and keeping an eye on future goals, we can strike this balance beautifully.\n\nHere's to an inspiring, impactful, and balanced year ahead!\n\n\nI'm cheering for you all!\nPlease send me clips and pics from the first day so Reza can include them in his district highlight reel; if you're using a cell phone, kindly capture the video in sideways (horizontal/landscape) mode. \nCheck out the district Linktree with all our links: https://linktr.ee/ciobcitywide\n\nciobcitywide | Twitter, Instagram, Facebook | Linktree\nLinktree.

Pls use Door A for entry. Check our website for updates. Let's make this year great!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nüß† Mental Model: The Change Paradox\n\nWe often want other people to change, but real change starts with ourselves. The Change Paradox reminds us that we change most effectively when we focus on being our true selves, rather than trying to be something we're not. Sometimes, what we wish others would change is actually something we should look at in ourselves. This is called projection. By understanding this concept, we can make real changes in our own lives. Importantly, this self-awareness helps us in supporting and serving others more effectively. When we lead by example and address our own areas for growth, we create a stronger, more understanding community for everyone involved.\n\n\n\n\n\nüìù **Insight: Weekly Reflection Practice**  \n\nSetting aside time each week to reflect on your challenges, successes, and goals can provide invaluable insights that can help you improve personally and professionally.\n\n\n\n\n\nüîç **Quote: Leadership Without a Title**  \n\nRobin Sharma once said, \"You don't need a title to be a leader.\" Influence, not authority, is the cornerstone of genuine leadership.\n\n\n\n‚ùì **Question: Small Positive Impact**  \n\nWhat small but meaningful impact can you make in your school community this week? Every little bit counts.\n\n\n\n\n\nüõ†Ô∏è **Tool Box: Promoting Good Attendance**  \n\n1. Use weekly newsletters to share statistics on the importance of attendance.\n\n2. Send automated reminders to parents about upcoming important school days.\n\n3. Recognize good attendance with small rewards or certificates.\n\n4. Use social media to share quotes and articles about the importance of attendance.\n\n5. Hold workshops to educate parents on the long-term impact of consistent attendance.\n\n6. Create a poster or infographic to display in communal areas.\n\n7. Share stories or testimonials from students who improved academically with better attendance.\n\n\n\n\n\nüë™ Recruiting Parent Leaders: Inspired by Strategies from PTO Today\n\nBe Specific About Needs: Clearly articulate what roles are available and what kind of help you need. People are more likely to step forward when they know what's expected.\n\nPersonal Invitations: Sometimes a direct ask is the most effective method. A personal conversation can often yield positive results.\n\nUtilize Social Media and Newsletters: Consistent and well-placed messaging across multiple channels increases visibility and can attract a diverse group of volunteers.\n\nOffer Short-Term Commitments: Not everyone can commit for an entire school year. Offering shorter terms or specific projects can draw in those who have limited time to offer.\n\nShowcase Success Stories: Share testimonials or experiences from current parent volunteers to demonstrate the impact one can make.\n\n(Source: Volunteer Recruitment Strategies for PTOs and PTAs - PTO Today)\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent Opportunities:\n\nMiddle and High School\nJoin a Climate Week Film Premiere and Panel Discussion About Climate Education and Community Resilience in NYC\nDeadline: September 16, 2023\nEvent: September 23, 2023\nContact: Emily Fano /917-301-8830\nJoin the National Wildlife Federation at Quad Cinema\n\n in Manhattan during Climate Week for a film premiere and panel discussion with students, teachers, and partners featured in the film. \"Where it Floods\" follows New York City students on the frontline of climate activism in Coney Island as they participate in RiSC, the climate education program that connects schools with local residents and organizations to help build community resilience.

Students focus on earning a diploma, attending college, pursuing a career, and other options after graduation. Academic grades and coursework, extracurricular activities, internships, and volunteer experience are very important. High school students will need help prioritizing responsibilities and meeting expectations.\n\nIn grades 9‚Äì12, students have more flexibility in the types of classes they take. Students are still required to take and pass classes in certain core subjects, including English, math, social studies, and science, but other course options and requirements may vary by school or program. While there are standard course sequences by grade level, some students may take classes in a different order.\nCollege and Career Readiness\nVisit the the pages below to learn more about:\n\nGraduation Requirements: specific information on credits and diploma types\nCareer and Technical Education: high school programs that focus on specific types of work\nCollege and Career Planning: college applications and financial aid\n\n\nWhat‚Äôs high school for?: From Seth Godin https://seths.blog/2011/05/whats-high-school-for/\n\nWhat‚Äôs high school for?\nPerhaps we could endeavor to teach our future the following:\n\nHow to focus intently on a problem until it‚Äôs solved.\nThe benefit of postponing short-term satisfaction in exchange for long-term success.\nHow to read critically.\nThe power of being able to lead groups of peers without receiving clear delegated authority.\nAn understanding of the extraordinary power of the scientific method, in just about any situation or endeavor.\nHow to persuasively present ideas in multiple forms, especially in writing and before a group.\nProject management.
