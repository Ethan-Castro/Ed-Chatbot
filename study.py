If you haven't already done so, please share with us the name and email address of your selected parent representative. Should your school not have a current PTA president, collaborate with your principal to identify a parent who resonates well with your school's community values. **Compliance Tasks:** Compliance: Please make sure you make some time to update SPLCI, PCAR and Continue to give creation codes for families that have not activated their NYC Schools Accounts.
